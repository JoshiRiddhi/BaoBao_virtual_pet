# BaoBao_virtual_pet
BaoBao is a virtual pet panda that will keep you company as you complete daily tasks. The goal is for this to be compatible to Microsoft Teams for school, where BaoBao's sustenance is dependent on the number of overdue assignments. Going over a certain threshold for overdue assignments, or assignments that are not submitted withing 24 hours of the deadline will cause BaoBao to die.  Completing enough assignments will reincarnate the panda.
